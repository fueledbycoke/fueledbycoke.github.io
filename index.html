                    <p>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by FromSoftware. It was
                        released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in March 2019 and for Stadia in October 2020
                        by FromSoftware in Japan and Activision internationally. The game follows a shinobi known as
                        Wolf, who attempts to take revenge on a samurai clan that imprisoned him and kidnapped his lord.
                        The gameplay is focused on stealth, exploration, and combat, with a particular emphasis on boss
                        battles. It takes place in a fictionalized Japan during the Sengoku period and makes strong
                        references to Buddhist mythology and philosophy.

                        Lead director Hidetaka Miyazaki wanted to create a new intellectual property (IP) that marked a
                        departure from their Dark Souls series, looking at games such as Tenchu for inspiration. Sekiro
                        was praised by critics, who complimented its gameplay and setting, and compared it to Dark
                        Souls, although opinions on its difficulty were mixed. It won several year-end awards and sold
                        over five million copies by July 2020.

                        Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive
                        open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the
                        primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players
                        can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by
                        stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players
                        to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online
                        multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player
                        combat.
